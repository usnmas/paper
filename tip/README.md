# Tips and Tricks 

When you write a paper, you should keep the followings in mind. 

- **Thesis vs Article** : The thesis propose a problem, whereas the article proposes a solution. 
- **Implementation** : In research, we do not implement a solution, but suggest a solution. 
- **Focus** : Not on the whole journey which describes everything in detail including the procedures, But on the outcomes and the differentiations. 
- **Test Methods** : Relate to the proposal and describe why they are selected. 
- **For Other Researchers** : The paper does not need to be a good reference guide for those who are going to study as a follow-up research.
